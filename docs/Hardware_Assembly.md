# Hardware Assembly

In this chapter you'll see how to assembly all the hardware parts to construct your car!

### 1) Prepare all parts
Make sure you have all parts next to you before you start
- The chassis (underbody)
- Two motors
- Two motor-wheel connectors
- Battery pack
- Expansion board to connect motors and Raspberry Pi
- Two gummed back wheels
- Two front wheels (including axle)
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- Two screws

Additionally, you will need the following:
- Crosstip screwdriver
- Scissors or a stanley knife
- File (optional)

First, remove the brim from the motor-wheel connectors. You can do this either by hand or with the help of a scissor

Do the same with the chassis:

Check if you can put one of the motors into the motor bracket. You should feel a certain resistance but the brackets shouldn't bend to much. You may want to use a file and carefully abrade the little rise in the motor bracket:

### 2) Front wheels
Take the wheel with axle and put it through the front part of the chassis. Then, with some pressure put the other wheel on it. Again, you may want to **use a file** to carefully abrade the axle which makes it easier to assemble the front wheel part.

### 3) Back wheels
Take the motor-wheel connector and place it in the wheel so the rectangular part is visible from the back side:

Next, screw the motor-wheel connector to the wheel.

Repeat with the second back wheel and plug the motor-wheel connector on the motors.

Afterwards, put both back wheel into the motor bracket.
