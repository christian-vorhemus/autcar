# Autonomous Driving

This documents gives an overview how you can collect training data, train the car and start the autonomous driving mode.

## Create track

Your car has to know when it is "on track" and when it leaves the track. Therefore, you need to prepare a circuit that has the following properties:
- The boundaries of the track should be clearly distinguishable from the ground.
- The right and left borders should have different colors.
Below, you see an example of a suitable track
