# Autonomous Driving

This documents gives an overview how you can collect training data, train the car and start the autonomous driving mode.

### 1) Create track

Your car has to know when it is "on track" and when it leaves the track. Therefore, you need to prepare a circuit that has the following properties:
- The boundaries of the track should be clearly distinguishable from the ground.
- The right and left borders should have different colors.
Below, you see an example of a suitable track

Also make sure that the track is wide enough for the car to be able to take bends well.

Additionally, take the the following into account:
- Choose a room with uniform lighting. Backlighting can deteriorate the result.
- The total circuit size should be between 2x2 meters
